## Arduino Paintball Bomb

This is my first small hardware project i made in 2017 for making paintball / airsoft matches more interesting. It's made with an
Arduino Uno, a 4x4 keyboard matrix, some led's and a piezo speaker. This project doesn't include a real time clock, so it's not very accurate. Here is a [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIAF0eOptqk)
